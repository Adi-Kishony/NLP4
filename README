The only deviation we made from the given template was adding the following getter methods to the DataMapper class:

    def get_dataset(self):
        return self.sentiment_dataset

    def get_sentences(self, data_subset=TRAIN):
        return self.sentences[data_subset]

This was done so that we could access the dataset and sentences from the
DataMapper object and use then in the getter function for the special subsets during evaluation.
We also therefore added an optional DataManager parameter to this function - when supplied we evaluate for the special subsets.
